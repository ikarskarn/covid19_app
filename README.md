# Covid-19 Data: Estimate the Risk

The Covid-19 App is developed by Marc Tucker and built to provide users with a place to go where they can retreive a quick overview of confirmed cases in the United States.  The search can be narrowed down to individual States.  Furthermore, the data will include estimates of what to expect in the next two weeks.  Using these estimates, users can plan accordingly.
